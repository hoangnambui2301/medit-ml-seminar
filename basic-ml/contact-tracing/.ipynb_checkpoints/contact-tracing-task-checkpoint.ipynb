    "Before going to the main model, we want you to have a fundamental view about the algorithm. DBSCAN is a popular **unsupervised** learning method utilized in model building and machine learning algorithms. in machine learning, unsupervised learning aims to identify patterns in data sets containing data points that are neither classified nor labeled. Indeed, clustering is one of the main concern of unsupervised learning problems. \n",
    "**DBSCAN** is a clustering algorithm specified for seeking areas in the data that have a high density of observation versus areas that are sparse with observations. DBSCAN works with these rules:\n",
    "- Divides the dataset into n dimensions\n",
    "- For each point in the dataset, DBSCAN forms an n dimensional shape around that data point, and then counts how many data points fall within that shape.\n",
    "- DBSCAN counts this shape as a cluster. DBSCAN iteratively expands the cluster, by going through each individual point within the cluster, and counting the number of other data points nearby. Take the graphic below for an example:\n",

    "\n",
    "After DBSCAN has done so, it will start at a random point (in this case lets assume it was one of the red points), and it will count how many other points are nearby. DBSCAN will continue this process until no other data points are nearby, and then it will look to form a second cluster. \n",
    "There are a couple parameters and specifications that we need to give DBSCAN before it does its work. These are: \n",
    "- eps: the maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as in the neighborhood of the other.\n",
    "- min_samples: the number of samples (or total weight) in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as a core point. This includes the point itself.\n",
    "- metric: the metric to use when calculating distance between instances in a feature array."
